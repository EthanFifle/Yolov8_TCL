install Anacond

Before running the following command set your project interpolator to the (base) interpolator of anaconda
    - Found in this directory on windows: C:\Users\(your_urs_name\anaconda3

conda create -n Yolov8_TCL python=3.11
conda activate Yolov8_TCL

Once the environment is activated run:

If on Windows or Mac & only using CPU:
pip install -r requirements.txt

*** NOTE: this step is only needed if you plan on using a GPU ***
Once GPU requirements are installed you MUST go to:
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to install the Pytorch version/build for your machine

Once everything is complete, make sure to set your new conda enrolment named (Yolov8_TLC) as
your python interpolator for the project.
