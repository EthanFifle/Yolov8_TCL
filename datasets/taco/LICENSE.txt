The dataset includes 14170 images.
Trash are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 74 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -37 and +37 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -75 and +75 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -52 and +52 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 3.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 7 percent of pixels
